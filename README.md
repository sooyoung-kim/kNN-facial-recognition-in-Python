## Facial Recognition System using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

##### CIS531: Problem-Solving with Machine Learning

###### In this project, I implemented k-NN to classify images of faces: 
###### - Found the nearest neighbors, 
###### - Calulated absolute loss, 
###### - Performed k-NN classification on a data set, 
###### - And calculated the accuracy of the classifier.
