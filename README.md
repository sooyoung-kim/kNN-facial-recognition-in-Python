## Facial Recognition System using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

##### CIS531: Problem-Solving with Machine Learning

In this project, I implemented k-NN to classify images of faces: 
1. Found the nearest neighbors
2. Calulated absolute loss 
3. Performed k-NN classification on a data set
4. Calculated the accuracy of the classifier
